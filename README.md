# Cat-Maze-

I have develop a maze game as my project. This maze game will have several rules and limitation to ensure the difficulty level of the game and to guarantee the progress of maze. 

In my design, players embark on an exciting adventure of guiding a cat to find a fish. This maze game is a console-based maze game which employed a **DFS** algorithm for maze generation (DFS stands for depth first search) which will find the first possible path to exit the maze. The maze is depicted as a character grid with distinct symbols denoting walls, paths, player, exit, energy, and solution. The program adheres to a procedural programming approach, employing various functions to manage maze generation, player movement, energy levels, including user interface

Here's a brief introduction to my maze game character:
 # : Border
‚ö°: Energy boost
üò∫: Cat character
üêü: End of maze

At the landing page, there will be an ASCII menu showing the cat image, choose to start the maze.

Furthermore, players can choose the difficulty level in the terminal section after executing the code.
