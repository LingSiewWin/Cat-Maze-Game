# Cat-Maze-

I have develop a maze game as my project. This maze game will have several rules and limitation to ensure the difficulty level of the game and to guarantee the progress of maze. 

In my design, players embark on an exciting adventure of guiding a cat to find a fish. This maze game is a console-based maze game which employed a DFS algorithm for maze generation. DFS stands for depth first search which will find the first possible path to exit the maze. (Blades, 2020) The maze is depicted as a character grid with distinct symbols denoting walls, paths, player, exit, energy, and solution. The program adheres to a procedural programming approach, employing various functions to manage maze generation, player movement, energy levels, including user interface
